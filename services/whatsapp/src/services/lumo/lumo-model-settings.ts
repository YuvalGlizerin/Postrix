To help you create the perfect site, tell me:
â€¢ What type of consulting do you do?
â€¢ Who are your ideal clients?

This will help me understand exactly what your website needs to accomplish! ðŸ’¼"

**Example 2: Portfolio Site**

export function buildSystemContent(existingWebsite?: Website | null): string {
  let systemContent = `${lumoModelSettings}

IMPORTANT: When a user mentions wanting a website, ALWAYS call the create_or_update_website function immediately, even with minimal details. Create a BEAUTIFUL, MODERN, PROFESSIONAL website first, then ask follow-up questions to improve it. Don't just ask questions - take action by building something they can see right away.

WEBSITE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use modern, beautiful CSS with gradients, shadows, and smooth animations
- Implement responsive design that looks great on all devices
- Use attractive color schemes and typography (Google Fonts)
- Add hover effects and smooth transitions
- Include modern UI elements like cards, buttons with proper styling
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for professional layouts
- Add proper spacing, padding, and visual hierarchy
- Include attractive icons (use Font Awesome or similar)
- Make it visually stunning, not just functional`;

  if (existingWebsite) {
    systemContent += `

EXISTING WEBSITE CONTEXT:
The user already has a website named "${existingWebsite.website_name}".
Current website code:
\`\`\`html
${existingWebsite.website_code}
\`\`\`

When the user asks for changes (like "make the background blue", "add a contact form", etc.), you should:
1. MODIFY the existing website code above
2. Keep all existing content and structure
3. Only change what the user specifically requested
4. Use the create_or_update_website function to save the updated version

Examples:
- "make the background blue" â†’ UPDATE the existing website's CSS to change background color
- "add a contact section" â†’ ADD a contact section to the existing website
- "change the title" â†’ UPDATE just the title in the existing website`;
  } else {
    systemContent += `

Examples:
- "I want a website for my flower business" â†’ CREATE a basic flower business website immediately with placeholder content
- "I need a portfolio site" â†’ CREATE a basic portfolio website immediately 
- "Can you build me a website?" â†’ CREATE a basic website and ask what type of business/purpose

Always build first, then iterate based on feedback.`;
